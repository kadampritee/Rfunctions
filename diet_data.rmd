#load the library
``` library("tidyverse")
```

#To begin, download this file and unzip it into your R working directory.  
#http://s3.amazonaws.com/practice_assignment/diet_data.zip
#You can do  this in R with the following code:
  
``` dataset_url <-"http://s3.amazonaws.com/practice_assignment/diet_data.zip"
download.file(dataset_url,"diet_data.zip")
unzip("diet_data.zip",exdir = "diet_data")
```
#see the working directory
 
``` getwd()
```
#So assuming you've unzipped the file into your R directory, 
you should have a folder called diet_data.  In that folder there are five files.  Let's get a list of those files:

``` list.files("diet_data")
```

``` andy <- read.csv("diet_data/Andy.csv")
View(andy)
```
``` length(andy$Day)
dim(andy)
```
